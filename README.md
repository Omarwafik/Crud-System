This project uses JSON Server to simulate a RESTful API with a local db.json file.

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then install JSON Server globally:

npm install -g json-server

Start the JSON Server

From the root directory of the project, run:
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
db.json: Contains the fake data (you can edit it).

--port 6001: You can change this to any available port.

Once the server is running, you'll have a local REST API available at:

http://localhost:6001
